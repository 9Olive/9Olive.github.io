Hello, and welcome to my humble site. My name is Joseph, I am an insatiousably curious person. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Statistics, a fascinating field of mathematics that I chose to stop being ignorant about. It's is also a wonderful toolkit to adopt in our ever flooding production of data.

What to expect?
