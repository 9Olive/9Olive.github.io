# Personal stuff

Welcome to this personal page about me. I am graduate of NC State University's Online Masters in Statistics [program](https://online-distance.ncsu.edu/program/master-of-statistics/). Prior to NCSU, I was performing commerical lab work as an Analytical Chemist. 

Analytical Chemists develop and carry out test methods designed to measure various physical and chemical properties of drugs. These test methods adhere to strict [Federal](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/pharmaceutical-quality-resources/current-good-manufacturing-practice-cgmp-regulations) and [International](http://www.jpma.or.jp/english/about_us/about_us.html) guidelines that ensure their effectiveness regardless of the lab or scientist that generates the data. As I generated data in my tenure as a Chemist, I realized that I was more drawn to how that data was used  than performing the lab work. 

Two years ago I embarked on a journey to switch my career from being an Analytical Chemist to [Data Scientist](https://9olive.github.io/blog/2020/05/15/ST558_Blog_1.html). I am a scientist through and through, and I enjoy exploring topics methodically. I personally started this website  as a forum to express my scientific endeavors. I enjoy learning about new sources of data, or rediscovering the value of a long forgotten dataset. Putting my mind to complex tasks is my way of relaxing. I am especially enthused by learning new technology and experimental techniques. 

Beyond the keyboard, I live an active lifestyle with my life partner, Holly. I run around [20 miles](https://www.strava.com/athletes/42253730) a week. I enjoy listening to audio books and podcasts on my runs. My top podcasts are [Not So Standard Deviations](www.nssdeviations.com) with [Hillary Parker](https://twitter.com/hspter) and [Roger Peng](https://twitter.com/rdpeng), and [The Portal](https://ericweinstein.org/) with [Eric Weinstein](https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein). When I am not running, I am playing tennis, casually biking, or taking a stroll in the woods. Indoors, I enjoy reading, gaming, and a little movie/TV time. Currently I am reading [Writings on an Ethical Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29379.Writings_on_an_Ethical_Life) by [Peter Singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer), dabbling in [Sid Meier's Civilization VI](https://civilization.com/), and consuming [The Crown](https://youtu.be/JWtnJjn6ng0) on Netflix. 

Thanks for checking out my website!
