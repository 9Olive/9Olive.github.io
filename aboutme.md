Hello, and welcome to my humble site. I have spent the past 5 years of my life indulging my curiousity of the physical sciences. My  intention with this website is to share some of the topics that I explore. Currently my site is under some construction, and will be for a short time as juggle 2 jobs, school, and pursuing a higher career in science. 

As my site is coming together, please take a look as some other interesting palces on the internet.
