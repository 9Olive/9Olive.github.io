subtitle: Writing assignment for ST558 - Data Science for Statisticians 
--- 

Data Science for Statisticians has been one of my most enjoyable courses in my Master's of Statistic program at NCSU. The course plays to my strengths while building on areas I am weak in. I really enjoy coding in R, and especially leveraging the speed and efficiency of the Tidyverse suite of packages. With that, I still have a lot of statistical theory from other courses that are "backlogged" in terms of codifying them in programs. 

The format of the course is ideal for beginner R users and intermediate R users. Given that I am taking the course over the summer, I feel that the faster pace caters to an intermediate R user. I do wish that the TA was able to provide more detailed feedback on code, similar to feedback given when one sumbits a paper in an English class. I acknowledge this is likely harder to do than reviewing essays, but I think the class would really elevate the students' coding style thus better preparing them for industry of research in academia.

Overall, I feel great about this course! I'm looking forward to the next half of subject matter, especially the sections on Tensorflow, Deep Learning, writing our own APIs and Docker containers.
