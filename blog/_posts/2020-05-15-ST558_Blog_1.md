# Data Science for Statisticians

For the first blog post in ST558, several articles were shared, and after reading them we are to respond to the prompts quoted below. 

> What do you think being a data scientist is about?  

Data Science - When you boil it down, it's just applied statistics. To apply statistics in the modern day, one needs to have the ability to operate computers at scale and translate domain specific knowledge into program logic. Yet without statistics, data science would be in the state of technology that defined the mid-90's to early 2000's. Back then, being able to automate a tedious process that may have replaced an admin role was cutting edge. As the roles, or problems, due to be automated presented more complexity with less routine there became a need to siphon data methodically. Statisticians have been diligent stewards of data for centuries. Thus the merging of statistics with scaled computation to solve domain specific problems was not only natural but required. Being a data scientist is about applying a statistical framework using sophisticated computational techniques to solve problems. 


> What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 

Their duty is to explain the relationship between relevant factors and the solution to a problem. Some computational techniques prevent the scientist from explicitly understanding these relationships. Therefore a knowledge of computational algorithms and techniques should be within their ability. Most importantly, having specific knowledge about the subject matter is crucial. Without domain specific intel, one is bound to make a mistake similar to the image below.

> What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  

Statisticians and data scientist are similar up until they apply their work. Of course, depending on what the application is could mean that a statistician spends more time with theory than a data scientist, but in gist they tend to follow a similar path of investigating a problem and deriving a solution through inductive reasoning. When it comes time to applying their solution, a data scientist will employ programming languages, parallel cloud computing, and dashboards. That is not to say that statisticians do not leverage those technologies, however, their finished product might come in the form of a research paper, direct consultation, or delegation.

> How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

The personal view of self is one charactized by being a student of statistics aspiring to become a data scientist. Developing a rock solid foundation in statistics
pays off in handsome dividends when tackling difficult problems. As a data scientist - there will be challenging questions and intricate techonologcial implentations to face, but being able to break them down into bite sized mathematical chunks will be key to solving them.
