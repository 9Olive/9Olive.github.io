# From Boiler Room to Light

I'm slowly learning my workflow from analysis in Rstudio to posting to the web. 

## Code Chunking

It's important to me to be able to showcase my code. There are several ways to highlight code in Markdown documents. Let's try a couple:

```r
x <- rnorm(10)
y <- (x * 10) + runif(10, -10, 10)

plot(y ~ x)
lines(x, lm(y ~ x)$fitted)
```

How does that look?

</center>

Code chunk 2

{% highlight r %}
x <- rnorm(10)
y <- (x * 10) + runif(10, -10, 10)

plot(y ~ x)
lines(x, lm(y ~ x)$fitted)
{% endhighlight %}

Same image, but different code to pull render it.
