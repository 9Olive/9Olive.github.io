In the last R project for ST558, we were asked to build a dashboard using R's Shiny package. We were allowed to us any dataset, however there were constraints placed on what had to be done with the data. We were to perform an unsupervised learning task, 2 supervised learning task, implement an array of interactive UI design features, allow for user prediction using our supervised model, and allow for the data to be downloaded. All in all, this was a lengthy but reward project. You can find my link to the project below.
