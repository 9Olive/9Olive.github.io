Hello first post readers!
=========================

Thanks for stopping by. This post is going to be simple, as all I want
to do is simply outline what you can expect to see on my site, my
interests, and current occupation.

First off, my writing style is bland. It lacks flavor. It's chicken
filleted without seasoning. In this vein, I aim to be concise in
explaining ideas and working through projects together. At any rate,
feel free to comment with criticism.

I am currently studying statistics to support my interest in data
analytics. As of right now I am working my way through statistical
theory. I have a backlog of problems from that course that I will be
sharing on here. I will also post topics that span various areas of data
analytics such as machine learning, data visualization, and overall
workflow. I will also explore topics in neuroscience and how it relates
to data analytics, this field is referred to as network neuroscience.

In addition to school, I instruct math to children of all ages from 6 to
18 as well as manage a marketing database for a rental equipment
company. I might occasionally share my experiences in those roles.

Well, that is all for my first post. Thank you and I'll write you again
soon.
