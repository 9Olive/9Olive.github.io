## Professional Objective
I am interested in developing myself into the subject matter expert within your organization. I sprouted in my career as a pharmaceutical lab chemist. In those former roles, the core of my technical philosphy was shaped through rehersal of the scientific method. Additionally, I acquired a taste for decyphering, analyzing, and summarizing data. My professional interest led me to seek out Statistics. The past two years I have had the rare opportunity to study theoretical statistical methods while implementing practical solutions within a business. I look forward to working my scientific and statistical toolkit on your data to transform complex business practices in to levers and buttons to accomplish your mission. Below you will find my contact details, education, qualifications, and work experience.
